### Hi, I'm Jee ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer currently based in Nairobi, Kenya. Sometimes, I use data to solve problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m open for work and working partly for an early-stage startup.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and cataloguing all sort of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) in Python. I've contirubuted to the community with [posts](https://scotch.io/@jee) and curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-designdistributed-system-design). Looking to learn Flutter to kill two app stores with one stone ðŸ˜„
- ðŸŽ¨ Fun fact: I do charcoal paintings.
