### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

Software Engineer at Microsoft, and a dad.

- 🌱 I'm currently working on an personal user data storage service for M365 suite, in corperation with multiple partners and a complex net of dependencies. One day I just might get into the right details. 
- 🐱‍💻 In my intermission, I like to learn and catalogue all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in markdown and executable Jupyter Notebooks. I'm also learning C# and distributed design while applying many of these patterns at work.
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design) and [helpful posts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1).
- 🎨 Fun fact: I collect old coins, do charcoal paintings, play the guitar and trying but failing to crack good dad jokes.
