### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer currently based in Nairobi, KE. Sometimes, I use data to solve problems.

- 🔭 I’m open for work. I'm currently working partly for an early-stage startup.
- 🌱 I’m learning and cataloguing all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in executable Jupyter notebooks. I'm also learning Flutter to kill two app stores with one stone 😄
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with [posts](https://scotch.io/@jee) and curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design). 
- 🎨 Fun fact: I do charcoal paintings.
