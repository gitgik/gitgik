### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

Software Engineer at Microsoft, and a Dad.

- 🌱 I'm currently working on an internal greenfield project, with multiple stakeholders and with a complex net of dependencies. One day I might get into just the right details 😜 
- 🐱‍💻 In my intermission, I like to learn and catalogue all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in markdown and executable Jupyter notebooks. I'm also learning C# and distributed design while applying some patterns at work.
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with [helpful posts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1) and curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design). 
- 🎨 Fun fact: I do charcoal paintings, play the guitar and trying - but failing, not to crack some dad jokes.
