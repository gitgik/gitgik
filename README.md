### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft.

- 🌱 I'm currently working on an internal greenfield project, with multiple stakeholders and existing dependencies. One day I might get into the deets 😜 
- In my intermission, I like to learn and catalogue all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in markdown and executable Jupyter notebooks. I'm also learning C# and distributed design while applying some patterns at work.
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with [helpful posts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1) and curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design). 
- 🎨 Fun fact: I do charcoal paintings.
