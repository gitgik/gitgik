### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft. Sometimes, I use data to solve problems.

- 🌱 I’m learning and cataloguing all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in executable Jupyter notebooks. I'm also learning C# and Flutter to kill two app stores with one stone 😄
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with [helpful posts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1) and curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design). 
- 🎨 Fun fact: I do charcoal paintings.
