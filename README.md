### Hi, I'm Jee 👋

Software Engineer at Microsoft.

- 🌱 I'm currently working on a storage service for personal data in M365 that is shared between Edge and a myriad of M365 apps. It provides a single store for all natural personal data into a single API and storage layer to consolidate understanding of the user across work and life - fully schematized. One day I just might excavate more details. 
- 🔭 In my intermission, I like to learn and catalogue all sorts of [algorithms](https://github.com/gitgik/data-structures-implementation) –– available in markdown and executable Jupyter Notebooks. I'm also learning C# and distributed design while applying many of these patterns at work.
- 🌍 I've contributed to the community with curated [system design approaches](https://github.com/gitgik/distributed-system-design) and [helpful posts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1).
- 🎨 Fun fact: I collect old coins, do charcoal paintings, play the guitar and trying but failing to crack good dad jokes.
